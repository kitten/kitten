### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a notorious tinkerer and obsessed with developer tooling and the web platform.
I currently work at [GraphCDN](https://graphcdn.io/), was formerly working as a Developer Advocate at [Formidable](https://formidable.com), and am involved in
Open Source projects like:

- [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) â€” CSS-in-JS for React
- [`wonka`](https://github.com/kitten/wonka) â€” streams in Reason
- [`urql`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql) â€” the flexible GraphQL client
- [`react-ssr-prepass`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-ssr-prepass) â€” A server-side tree walker for prepass React Suspense support
- and some more...

You may also know me from the font I created, [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).

**I'm always happy to hear from people who use my work, or get some questions that I can answer.
