### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a notorious tinkerer and obsessed with developer tooling and the web platform.

I currently am working on supporting my Open Source work full-time at [0No Co.](https://github.com/0no-co).
You can check out the digital flyer version of 0No Co's pitch at [0no.co](https://0no.co), and reach out
if you'd like support with [`urql`](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql), or the Web Perf/DX/UX space.

You may also know me from the font I created, [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).

**I'm always happy to hear from people who use my work, or get some questions that I can answer.
Feel free to reach out to me [on Mastodon `@philpl@toot.cafe`](https://toot.cafe/@philpl) or [on Twitter `@_philpl`](https://twitter.com/_philpl)!**
